Welcome to the Choco++ Data Management System, this readme file will guide you
through compiling and running this program.

###########################################################################

#                           MAKEFILE OPTIONS
#
###########################################################################

The Makefile comes with two primary compile targets:
    chocoplusplus - This executable is the demonstration terminal for testing 
                    and demonstrating a potential user experience of Choco++'s
                    datamanagement services.
    tests - This executable will run a series of tests on Choco++'s component
            functions. This target will compile in verbose mode, and will 
            output MySQL calls as well as other debugging information.
            run the program with the command: "./tests > logfile" in order
            to save the output to a log which you can inspect at your leisure.
Finally, "make all" or simply "make" will compile both targets.
