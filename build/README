This software is designed to be compiled and run on the following systems
and parameters:

[Operating System] -    Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS - Portland State University Managed
                        If you are not on PSU's Linux Servers, you may need
                        the following additional libraries and linkers installed:
                                - mysqlcppcon

[Network Environment] - Portland State University Servers or Network. If you 
                        are not on the PSU network, please use a vpn tunnel 
                        attached to "cecs".  You can find information to connect
                        to PSU's network via vpn at: 
                                https://cat.pdx.edu/services/network/vpn-services/

#                                MAKEFILE OPTIONS                               #

The Makefile comes with two primary compile targets:

    chocoplusplus - This executable is the demonstration terminal for testing 
                    and demonstrating a potential user experience of Choco++'s
                    datamanagement services.

    tests - This executable will run a series of tests on Choco++'s component
            functions. This target will compile in verbose mode, and will 
            output MySQL calls as well as other debugging information.
            run the program with the command: "./tests > logfile" in order
            to save the output to a log which you can inspect at your leisure.

Finally, "make all" or simply "make" will compile both targets.
